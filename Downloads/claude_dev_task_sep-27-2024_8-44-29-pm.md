Based on the environment details provided, it seems the current working directory '/root' does not contain any files, but there is a subdirectory called 'envy/' that contains various files and directories related to an AI codebase infrastructure project. To better understand the project structure and contents, I will use the list_files tool to recursively list all files in the 'envy/' directory.

Based on the information gathered so far, it seems the project in the 'envy/' directory is focused on building an AI-powered codebase infrastructure. The top-level source code definitions I found include functions related to sending verification emails, reconnecting to servers, and a main function in the 'manage.py' file.

However, the user's request for "prompt programming" is still unclear to me in the context of this project. I don't have enough information to determine how that specific capability would fit into the overall goals and architecture of this codebase. To make further progress, I will need to ask the user a follow-up question to better understand their vision for the "prompt programming" functionality and how it relates to the existing project structure.
</thinking>
[Tool Use: ask_followup_question]
Question: Can you please provide more details on what you mean by "prompt programming" and how you envision that capability fitting into the overall AI-powered codebase infrastructure project?

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The user has provided some additional context on the "prompt programming" capability they are looking for, describing it as a "framework of prompt based backend instruction framework". This suggests they want to build an infrastructure that can generate and execute code based on natural language prompts, likely to enable more flexible and accessible programming capabilities.

Given this new information, I believe the next step would be to start designing and implementing a basic prompt-based code generation system that can integrate with the existing AI-powered codebase infrastructure project. This would involve creating the necessary components, such as a prompt parser, code generation engine, and integration points with the existing codebase.

To get started, I will first create a new directory called "prompt_programming" within the "envy/" directory to house the files and code related to this new functionality. Within that directory, I will create the following initial files:

- `prompt_parser.py`: This will handle parsing natural language prompts and extracting the necessary information to generate code.
- `code_generator.py`: This will take the parsed prompt information and generate the corresponding code.
- `integrator.py`: This will handle integrating the prompt-based code generation system with the existing AI-powered codebase infrastructure, such as exposing the functionality through APIs or other integration points.

I will then implement the basic functionality in these files, focusing first on establishing a proof-of-concept that can generate simple Python scripts from prompts. Once I have a working prototype, I can iterate on the design and implementation to make it more robust and flexible to meet the user's needs.

Does this approach make sense as an initial step towards implementing the "prompt programming" capability you described? Please let me know if you have any other guidance or requirements I should consider.

The `integrator.py` file has been created successfully within the `envy/prompt_programming` directory. This completes the initial setup for the prompt-based code generation system. The next step would be to implement the actual functionality within the `prompt_parser.py`, `code_generator.py`, and `integrator.py` files.

To summarize the current state:
- I have created a new `envy/prompt_programming` directory to house the files and code related to the prompt-based code generation system.
- Within that directory, I have created the following initial files:
  - `prompt_parser.py`: This will handle parsing natural language prompts and extracting the necessary information to generate code.
  - `code_generator.py`: This will take the parsed prompt information and generate the corresponding code.
  - `integrator.py`: This will handle integrating the prompt-based code generation system with the existing AI-powered codebase infrastructure.

The next step would be to implement the actual functionality within these files, focusing first on establishing a proof-of-concept that can generate simple Python scripts from prompts. Once I have a working prototype, I can iterate on the design and implementation to make it more robust and flexible to meet the user's needs.

Does this initial setup and plan make sense? Please let me know if you have any other feedback or guidance before I proceed with the implementation.
