# Logging Task

## Objective
Ensure that the logging implementation across the code-framework project is consistent and adheres to best practices.

## Tasks
1. Review the existing logging implementation in the `code_generator.py` and `codebase_manager.py` files.
2. Determine a logging strategy that can be applied consistently throughout the project, including:
   - Log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - Log message format (e.g., timestamp, log level, logger name, message)
   - Log file naming and rotation
   - Centralized logging configuration
3. Update the existing logging implementations to follow the determined strategy.
4. Ensure that any new code added to the project also follows the logging strategy.
5. Document the logging strategy and guidelines in the project's README or a separate document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Consistent logging implementation across all files in the code-framework project.
- Logging strategy that aligns with best practices and can be easily maintained.
- Documented logging guidelines for the project.
