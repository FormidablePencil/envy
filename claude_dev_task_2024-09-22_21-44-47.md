# New Task: Implement Changes for CORS and Dynamic Task History

## Dan then man's injected notes
The last priority needs the second one and two.

## Objective
1. Change the CORS amount for the application.
2. Update the method for keeping track of exporting history and implement a dynamic way to update the task history by reference.
3. Establish access levels for contributors to benefit from and contribute to the task history.
4. Implement a synchronization mechanism for the tasks.

## Steps to Implement
### 1. Change CORS Amount
- Access the application settings where CORS is configured.
- Modify the CORS settings to reflect the new amount.
- Test the application to ensure that CORS changes are functioning as expected.

### 2. Update Task History Tracking
- Research methods for dynamically updating task history.
- Implement a system that allows for real-time updates to the task history.
- Ensure that the system can reference previous tasks and changes.

### 3. Establish Access Levels
- Define user roles and access levels for contributors.
- Implement a system that manages permissions for accessing and modifying task history.
- Test the access control system to ensure it works as intended.

### 4. Implement Synchronization
- Research synchronization methods that can be applied to the task history.
- Develop a synchronization mechanism that allows for real-time updates across instances.
- Test the synchronization system to ensure it functions correctly.

## Expected Outcomes
- CORS settings will be updated successfully.
- A dynamic task history system will be in place, allowing for real-time updates.
- Access levels will be established, ensuring proper permissions for contributors.
- A synchronization mechanism will be implemented for task history.

## Notes
- Ensure thorough testing of all implemented changes to avoid disruptions in the workflow.
