# Updated Task: Change Machine Type from 4 to 2 Cores

## Objective
Modify the machine configuration to reduce the number of cores from 4 to 2.

## Steps to Implement
1. **Access the Cloud Provider Console**:  
   - Log in to the cloud provider's management console where the machine is hosted.

2. **Locate the Instance**:  
   - Navigate to the section where your virtual machines or instances are listed.
   - Identify the instance that needs to be modified.

3. **Modify Machine Type**:  
   - Select the instance and look for the option to change the machine type or configuration.
   - Change the number of cores from 4 to 2.

4. **Save Changes**:  
   - Confirm and save the changes to apply the new configuration.

5. **Restart the Instance**:  
   - If required, restart the instance to ensure the new settings take effect.

## Expected Outcomes
- The machine will operate with 2 cores instead of 4, potentially reducing costs and resource usage.

## Notes
- Ensure that the application running on the machine can handle the reduced resources without performance degradation.
